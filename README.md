# Legal Discovery FHE: A Secure Multi-Party Legal Evidence Platform

Legal Discovery FHE harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to enable secure and efficient legal discovery among multiple parties. By allowing parties to share FHE-encrypted evidence files in a virtual data room, this platform revolutionizes the way legal evidence is handled, ensuring confidential and compliant interactions throughout the legal process.

## The Challenge in Legal Discovery

In traditional legal proceedings, sharing legal evidence raises significant concerns related to confidentiality and data security. Multiple legal parties involved in a case often need to exchange sensitive information, which may expose them to potential breaches of privacy or misuse of the data. Additionally, traditional methods of evidence review can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and can lead to less reliable outcomes due to the risk of unintentional disclosure.

## The FHE Advantage

The **Legal Discovery FHE** project utilizes **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, to implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption. This unique technology enables the execution of keyword searches and counting operations on encrypted data, allowing legal professionals to glean insights without ever needing to decrypt sensitive documents. By operating in a secure virtual environment, this solution mitigates the risks associated with data leaks and ensures that all parties maintain their confidentiality while collaborating effectively.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Legal Evidence:** All evidence files are securely encrypted using advanced FHE techniques.
- **Homomorphic Keyword Searches:** Perform keyword searches on encrypted documents without exposing the underlying data.
- **Multi-Party Collaboration:** Facilitate interactions among various parties while preserving the confidentiality of all shared documents.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Enhance the speed and security of legal disclosures, making the legal process smoother and more trustworthy.
- **User-Friendly Virtual Data Room:** A dedicated search interface that transforms how legal professionals access and analyze sensitive information.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Node.js** for server-side operations
- **Hardhat/Foundry** for smart contract development
- **Solidity** for writing smart contracts
- **React.js** for building the user interface

## Installation Instructions

To set up the **Legal Discovery FHE** project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory you've downloaded (do not use `git clone`).
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Instructions

Once the dependencies are installed, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working as expected:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Example Code Snippet

Here is a simple example of how to perform a keyword search in the **Legal Discovery FHE** platform. This demonstrates searching for the keyword “confidential” within the encrypted document collection:

```javascript
import { FHEClient } from 'zama-fhe-sdk';

async function searchDocuments(keyword) {
    const client = new FHEClient();
    const encryptedDocumentData = await client.fetchEncryptedDocuments();

    // Perform homomorphic search
    const searchResults = await client.homomorphicSearch(encryptedDocumentData, keyword);
    
    console.log("Search Results: ", searchResults);
}

// Usage
searchDocuments("confidential");
```

This code snippet illustrates how easy it is to implement homomorphic searches with Zama’s technology, demonstrating the platform's powerful capabilities while maintaining confidentiality.
